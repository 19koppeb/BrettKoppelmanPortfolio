                &emsp;&emsp;Throughout the duration of the Full Stack Summer Camp I learned a great deal of what it was like to actually be a part of a team and develop software. In school, it is essentially watch the teacher code, get a problem, and then go work on it by yourself until you figure it out. However, at the summer camp I found out this is not how software development works whatsoever. 
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;One thing I learned is that problems are going to occur frequently. The main issue of the summer camp  was figuring out how to get the Macs to run things properly and in unison with the windows computers. Every day there was a new problem with the Mac that would have to get solved or there would be no way to go on. The way that Ryan Bennett handled these problems showed that things like this are going to happen, and you need to find a way to fix it. Also, I definitely value google now a lot more than I used to
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another thing that was very important was the ability to work and communicate with a team. During AP Java I would sit and do problems mostly by myself, maybe asking someone next to me if I couldn’t figure it out. During the summer camp there was constant communication going on between the team, whether it was during group activities or individual activities. There was no staring at your computer screen and hoping it would eventually work. Working together as a team improved the speed that activities could be finished greatly and prepared us for real world situations much more than a class ever could. 
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;I also learned to work on a problem with the thought of the quality of the work in mind. In class, if you completed the problem and it worked with a few tests, you were done. Now, I truly understand that every line of code needs to be written with the thought of who is going to be using it, and who is it for. You have to expect that someone is going to input bad data into your code, and the code needs to be able to deal with it properly. Also I learned that the code needed to be efficient enough for a client. Having 20 if statements in a row might work, but it is extremely inefficient and will slow down your program. 
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Overall, the Full Stack Summer Camp was a remarkable experience that taught me how to deal with problems better, work together as a team fluently, and to think about the quality of the code that I am writing. This is an experience that I believe will help me succeed greatly, and I am grateful that I was able to participate in it.
