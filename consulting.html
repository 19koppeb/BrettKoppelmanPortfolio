                                &emsp;&emsp;When this problem was first given to us we were about halfway through the school year and had just finished AP Java and had recently heard about the opportunity of participating in the summer internship. This problem was given to us as a way to see who was really interested.
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;    First, we were asked to complete the problem in Java. This was a seemingly simple task since Java was still fresh in my memory and the problem was just simple data manipulation. I completed this problem in about an hour with little problems, the only one being trying to find out how to make the string input into an integer, which is when I discovered how to parse strings into integers.
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp; Then, during this summer camp to convert this into C#. C# and Java, both being object oriented languages, are fairly similar. The way I went about this was simply pasting my Java code into visual studio and searching to find out what syntax needed to be changed. This again went smoothly once all of the syntax had been changed as the problem was already completed.
