                            &emsp;&emsp;During our unit conversion project I believe that we worked well together as a team in order to complete our task. When the project was given to us we decided to try to complete the Javascript before attempting any of the styling. I believe this was a good way to attack this problem because once completed all we needed to worry about was styling around the Javascript, and we did not have to worry about implementing it later.
                            <br>&emsp;&emsp;This was a very helpful activity to help our team work together better because the pages that each of us made had to be the same design as everyone else. Because of this we needed to communicate while we completed our styling in order to keep the design consistent. One thing we needed to deal with was styling. We could not do any inline styling because when we would eventually merge there would inevitably be issues.
                            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Our source control for this activity is where the most improvement would be needed. Although we did not have any problems with our source control, when we were given a time crunch towards the end of the project we began to participate in unsafe merging techniques. We would merge into dev without making a pull request and everyone would not thoroughly test each others code. We now understand that proper source control techniques are necessary in order to ensure that our code merges together flawlessly without conflict.
