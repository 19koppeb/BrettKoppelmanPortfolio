                                &emsp;&emsp;	On the first day we started working on our final project we worked very well the first half of the day, and then began to slow down the second half of the day. Myself and a partner worked on the server side of the project, completing the delete, edit, and create page within the first few hours of the project. The second half did not go as well. We ran into problems regarding the communication to the database and with the search function.
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;The second day the main issue was still the searching function, as we could not get it to work. I learned that you should not put one person on the task of completing the search because it is such a large task and takes multiple brains to realize the problems that were occuring. Another issue was improving the styling, as the first day it did not look very good. 
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;The presentations of our projects was a great learning experience where we were put in a real world situation to try and sell our projects. It opened our eyes that even though we thought ours was good and did what we wanted it to do, there were other groups that had different features that might have been more efficient and user friendly.
