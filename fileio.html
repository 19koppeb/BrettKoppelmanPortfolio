                        <p align = left>&emsp;&emsp;Throughout the duration of the File IO project our team worked very well together in my opinion. When we were given the project, none of us knew how to do File IO very well, just some basic ideas here and there, let alone in C# as this was the first time any of us had attempted using this language. We all worked diligently together to figure out a solution to the main obstacle of file input, and then each received a task to manipulate the data and display something. Despite the 2-3 hours it took to complete this project, I believe we worked very fluently together as a team and did not have many conflicts where none of us knew what to do. We would sometimes think we had found the solution, and then we would all test it and it would not work, so we would have to keep searching. However, we did not get discouraged or angry and we continued to search for a solution which eventually we found.
                                The source control for this project worked very well. We each branched off dev and worked on our own section correctly, and when it came time to merge we followed the correct protocol. We each tested the code and would let the person who would make the pull request if the code would suffice. We continuously communicated throughout the duration of the project, whether it was to make a clarification for the correct syntax or to see who still needed to merge.
                                One thing that we could do better next time is creating a plan before attacking a problem. For File IO we simply read the problem and all went to try and find a way to solve it; similar to chickens running with their heads cut off, there was no order. Even though we found a solution in a rather short amount of time, it most likely will not always be that simple and there will need to be a plan of attack.
